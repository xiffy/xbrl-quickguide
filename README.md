# XBRL Quickguide
This is the source for my [XBRL Quickguide](https://cooljapan.nl/xbrl-quickguide.pdf). Errors, additions by Issues or Pull request.

The quide is published by using Pandoc and xelatex for both PDF and EPUB. I used a slighty altered Eisvogel as a template.

I wrote this guide with a typical programmer in mind. Someone who is familiar with XML and has to create xbrl documents or xbrl taxonomies. 
It breaks down the different parts of XBRL; Instances and Taxonomies. It shows you how to create an Instance based on a taxonomy. 
In the second part I'll give an introduction on how to write a taxonomy, and how to add stucture to this taxonomy by defining hierarchies of related concepts.
